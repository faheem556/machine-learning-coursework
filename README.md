# Machine Learning

I have started my journy with https://a16z.com/ai-canon/ 

Currently, I am going through two courses:
1. [Stanford CS229](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU): Introduction to Machine Learning with Andrew Ng, covering the fundamentals of machine learning.
2. [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING): Machine Learning, Data Science and Generative AI with Python


Idea is to do a crash course in one month. Try to finish 5 lectures in a week.
