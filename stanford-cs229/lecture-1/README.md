1. [Definitions](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=2177): Make machines decide without explicit instructions based on learning.
1. Problem Types: 
    1. [Regression](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=2565): Fit continous data on a path. For example estimated home prices based on sq/feet. Variable number of outputs.
    1. [Classification](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=2585): Categorize inputs into distinct buckets. Such as cancer types, moods of a person. Finite number of buckets and states.
1. [Thing about the real world problems](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=2925): A lot of "features"
1. [Machine learning strategy](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=3587): 
    1. Strategy is important: choose training data, training method, models
    1. Making the right choices in the process is really important
1. Deep learning: undestand the basics of training neural networks. CS230: covers deep learning more narrowly.
1. Learning types:
    1. [Supervised learning](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=3129): learning through labelled data. Such as through a function mapping from x to y
    1. [Unsupervised learning](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=3893): learning from unlabelled data. Only x but no y. Some examples included:
        1. Clustering algo in Google news which reviews and groups the articles together  
        1. Gene study - group people with similar features
        1. Social network analysis
        1. Market segementation
        1. Astronomical data analysis
        1. Organize computers clusters
        1. Cocktail party problem: When you record audio from a busy room with multiple microphones. Idea is to isolate speech from individuals. It's done using [Independent component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis)
        1. Internet has tons of unlabbeled data. Can you download and figure out interestig patterns?
    1. [Reinforcement Learning](https://youtu.be/jGwO_UgTS7I?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&t=4326): When there is no optimal way of learning but you do learning through experimentation. For example, you let the dog do whatever it does but then encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior.
        1. Examples in robotics / logistics section
        1. Examples in game learning: Go alpha types
